# L-Infinity Optimization to Linear Spaces and Phylogenetic Trees

This repository contains the supplementary materials referenced in the paper "L-infinity optimization to Linear Spaces and Phylogenetic Trees."

The file "MapleSupplement_4LeafDisticts.mw" is a Maple worksheet which generates the polyhedral subdivision of the space of dissimilarity maps on four elements referenced therein. The polyhedral subdivision is stored in a 37-element array called "Districts." Each entry of the array is a two-element list where the second entry is a set of trees and the first entry is a list of polyhedral cones comprising the district labeled by those trees. To execute these computations in Maple:

1. Check that you have a version of Maple that supports the package PolyhedralSets (available in Maple2015 and later versions)
2. Download and open the file MapleSupplement_4LeafDistricts.mw in Maple.
3. Evaluate the worksheet (this could take an hour or so)
